# Auto-Reply

After receiving a Crisp message, our system prioritizes matching the following keywords for automated responses.

**Note: Keyword-matched replies do not consume your platform balance. You can use them freely.**

## Creating Options

### Drag-and-Drop Sorting

You can adjust the triggering priority of your keywords by dragging them to reorder the list.

### Trigger Keywords

You can use regular expressions (Regex) or simple matching rules:

* `^Menu$`: Triggers only when the message is exactly the word "Menu".
* `Hello`: Triggers on any message containing "Hello" (e.g., "Hello, how are you?" or "Say Hello").
* `Help|Support`: Triggers on messages containing either "Help" or "Support" (e.g., "I need Help" or "Support please").

### Option Types

Once a keyword is matched, you can select the response type:

* **No Action**: Matches the content but does not send a response.
* **Reply Text**: Responds with a specific text message.
* **Reply Options**: Responds with interactive clickable options.
* **Disable Smart Reply**: Matches the content and then deactivates AI smart replies for that specific conversation.

## Test Matching Tool

Keyword triggers are matched in order from top to bottom. We provide a **Test Matching Tool** that allows you to quickly and intuitively see which keyword is triggered by a specific user input. The triggered keyword will be highlighted for easy identification.
