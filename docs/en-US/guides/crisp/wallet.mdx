# Wallet Information

In this section, you can view your current balance and top up your platform account.

### Top-up Instructions

* **First-time Top-up**: You will need to generate a wallet address. We currently support **USDT** on the **TRC-20** and **Polygon** networks.
* **Minimum Top-up**: The minimum deposit amount is **1 USDT**.
* **Other Payment Methods**: Currently, no other payment methods are supported for platform balance top-ups.

### Wallet Address

* **Permanent Address**: The generated address is your permanent wallet address.
* **Address Activation**: During your first top-up, the address may appear as "Inactive." You can activate it by sending a small amount of **TRX** (for TRC-20) or performing a standard deposit.

### Notifications

Once your top-up is successful, you will receive an automated notification regarding the balance update.
